A bug report also helps developers understand the issue quickly, prioritize it, and address it efficiently.
## Importance of a Good Bug Report:

# 3. Best Practices for Bug Reporting
   * No Assumptions: Use facts to report the issue. Never use assumptions to report something unclear
   * Reproduce first: Always reproduce the bug several times before reporting it to the dev team 
   * Be Specific: Provide detailed information about the bug & no unnecessary detail
   * Report Promptly: Report bugs as soon as they are identified
   * Clear Language: Write in clear & straightforward language

# 4. Follow-Up
   * Track Progress: Keep track of the reported bug's status and update the report if new information arises or if a re-test is needed after a fix is applied
   * Collaboration: Engage with the dev team, product/project managers, and other stakeholders for clarification

# 5. Common Mistakes to Avoid
   * Duplication: Always check the bug tracking system first before reporting the bug. This act is to ensure the bug hasnâ€™t already been reported
   * Incomplete reports: Lack of key details can delay bug resolution
   * Neglecting edge cases: Identify and report edge cases that may not be part of the main flow but could still lead to issues
